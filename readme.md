# Math game

_fun math game counter_

The game have a target number from 0 to 100. You must calculate the target number using the numbers from 0 to 9, but one number you can use only once per game. After one number, you must put the operator +, -, \*.
You have 30 seconds to solve the task. If you do it within 15 sec. you will get 2 points, if within 30s. - 1 point. More than 30 m. time is up and you are not awarded.
After one round you have few seconds to relax, and then next round.
Good luck :)
